##  Problem Statement

Manual transcription of audio is time-consuming, prone to errors, and inefficient. Professionals, students, and researchers often need fast, reliable transcription tools that work across platforms.

---

##  Solution Approach

This project uses:
- A **React.js** frontend to create an intuitive interface for uploading audio files.
- A **Spring Boot** backend to handle file processing and communication with the **AssemblyAI** transcription service.
- **AssemblyAI's REST API** to convert speech to text with high accuracy.
